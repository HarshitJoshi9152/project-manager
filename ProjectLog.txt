	1. decided to make a new db file for every new user that joins and 1 users.db file to keep track of the registered users.
	this means that this JSON structure is invalid now ...
	[
		{
			"user_name":[
				{
				"accomplished":false,
				"goalBody":"input from goalText input form.",
				"dueDate":"DD-MM-YYYY",
				"dateRegistered":"DD-MM-YYYY"
				}
			]
		}
	]

	2. i think that interacting with the DOM to get the srno. is releavtively slower than putting a srno in the requested object .

	1. came to know how to collect POST request data.
	2. changed the data structure to an array.
	3. we will experiment with the <form action="POST"> tag in html for submitting the data
	4. no - in dateRegistered key on object sent by client.
	5. the more i progress in the development of our application the more i feel that i should be using a 3rd party module.
	6. work done now we have to remove all the unnecessary console.log() calls and commit the code.
