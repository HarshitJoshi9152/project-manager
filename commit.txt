another step towards the 1st version of the working/fully-functional app
just minor improvements, fixed typos, 1 user 1 db system, ideas of a Registered-Users DB, ideas for improving GUI :
adding standard login system, idea of adding an email-reminder service, completed the make_table(data) function, 
figured out problems with the PUT request and the repetitive a-c-o-p:* header,
intoduced a project log file to document the mindset and decisions taken by the developer.

still no sql support.
scope for improvement of code in make_table(data) function of script.js.

NOTE: no idea has yet been implemented in the commited version.
