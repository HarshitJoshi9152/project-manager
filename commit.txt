well i honestly didnt get time to document my progress this time
but i did make some changes like removing the try and catch statement from the
server.js.

we fixed the immediate refresh of goals upon submission of new goal feature by
removing the try-catch and we found out that the problem was associated with the
different levels of variable scope in javascript.

made a new Dashboard.html page
